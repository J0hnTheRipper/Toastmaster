How many of you here likes cookies? How many of you want chocolate chip cookies? Well, if you vote for me for vice-president; or better yet, the club president, Everyone will get free cookies! --- Just kidding. In all seriousness,If you guys are here, it means you love this club. Yove love public speaking and you're not here for the cookies. I hope you wouldn't be sqayed by  any previous or folllowing briberis.  

I'm proud to say even through some of us might not be the strongest 

I love being a part of Toastmasters. I hope you guys are too. It's not only because of the great new people we get to meet daily, but everything we do here and now is making us a stronger character. Even if we might not be a well-known or agood speader, all of us still want to improve. YOu know, some people never tried. They think that standing in a room and talking about things  that everyone knows doesn't matter..but we're here to tell you it is. Talking make a diffference. ANd the fact that we'll all here, and ready to imrove our speaking skills indicate that we tried. But it that enoguh? No. It's not good enough to be just a member. I don't want to just come here and learn how to improve my public speaking. I'm here because I want everyone to benefit from this club. I want to take on a leader position because I want to help. I know I can help. 

You might be thinking, okay how can she help? What difference can she make? Well, if you haven't notice, over the last months we've been here, we see new members come in and come out. As part of my resposiblity as club president, I know 


Connecting to all people at this club not only meant 


But the fact that you're all here and all listenting means that you took the first step.  but don't you want to do more? Don't we all want to do more? SO, to me being a member isn't enough. Not only do I want to beneifit the world, but 


YOu will not be one of the person in this room 


if you choose to vote for me,You will not be the only one voting for me, everyone else will be.


I can grantee that there would be more benefits than if you vote for any one else. For one thing, can grantee that there would be more benefits than if you vote for any one else.
